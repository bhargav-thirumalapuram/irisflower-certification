README: Iris Flower Classification

Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using their sepal and petal measurements. The task is a multiclass classification problem and is based on the classic Iris dataset, which is widely used to explore fundamental machine learning concepts.

Approach

The process involved the following key steps:

Data Loading:

The Iris dataset was loaded directly using sklearn.datasets.load_iris().

Features included four numeric measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The target variable was mapped from numeric values (0, 1, 2) to the corresponding species names (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A pairplot visualization was used to understand feature distribution and the relationship between species.

Feature importance was analyzed after model training.

Preprocessing:

The dataset did not require cleaning as it is well-prepared in its raw form.

No missing values or categorical encodings were necessary.

The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Selection:

A Random Forest Classifier was chosen for its efficiency and ability to handle multiclass problems effectively.

Default hyperparameters were used in the initial run.

Model Training:

The Random Forest model was trained on the training data.

The target variable was the species, and the features were the numeric sepal and petal measurements.

Evaluation:

The model was evaluated using a classification report and accuracy score.

Feature importance analysis was visualized to understand the significance of each feature in the classification task.

Results

Accuracy Score: The model achieved a high accuracy score on the test data.

Feature Importance:

Petal measurements (length and width) were found to be more significant than sepal measurements for distinguishing species.

Visualization:

Pairplots showed clear separability between species, especially for petal-based features.

Challenges Faced

Data Separability: While petal features showed clear separability between species, sepal measurements provided less distinction, making them less predictive.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Default hyperparameters were used, which might not yield the absolute best results.

Model Selection: Exploring alternative models was limited to Random Forest due to its effectiveness and simplicity, but other models may perform differently.

How to Run

Install the required libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Run the Python script iris_classification.py in your environment.

The script will output:

Classification report and accuracy score in the console.

Visualizations for feature importance and pairplots.

Future Work

Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to improve model performance.

Explore alternative models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks for comparison.

Deploy the model as a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit for real-time predictions.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of multiclass classification and sets the stage for more advanced applications in machine learning.
